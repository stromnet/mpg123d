When using -w, --raw-status, you will get either 10 rows of data, or 1 row that says "Stopped"
If you get any data, they containd the following data:

time played (written as %.2f with sprintf, that is, a number with 2 decimals)
time left (written as %.2f with sprintf, that is, a number with 2 decimals)
Artist
Title
Album
Comment
Year
Genre

Bitrate

All fields but the timefields, and the genre field, can contaion 30 chars (excluding the \n)
The UDP protocol uses 10 bytes for the time field, so that should be enough (up to 9999999.99 seconds)
